Using coffee grounds as my primary medium, I craft textured portraits that transform an everyday material into expressive works of art. My practice explores the beauty of impermanence and the poetry found in discarded things. Each piece is a meditation on sustainability, creativity, and seeing potential where others see waste. Coffee fuels both my mornings and my art.\n\n**Connect:** [@aa.madeit](https://www.instagram.com/aa.madeit/)","type":"markdown"}], advanced={} %}
